Soft and sweet, with eyes so blue<br/>
A ragdoll cat, I'm so in love with you<br/>
Your fur is fluffy, your paws so white<br/>
I could cuddle with you, day and night<br/>
</p>
<p>
Oh, my ragdoll cat<br/>
You're the cutest thing I've ever had<br/>
Your purr is like music to my ears<br/>
I could hold you close, for years and years<br/>
</p>
<p>
You love to play and climb up high<br/>
But when you're tired, you'll curl up by my side<br/>
Your meows are gentle, your whiskers long<br/>
I'm so lucky to have you in my home<br/>
</p>
<p>
Oh, my ragdoll cat<br/>
You're the cutest thing I've ever had<br/>
Your purr is like music to my ears<br/>
I could hold you close, for years and years<br/>
</p>
<p>
I don't know what I'd do without you<br/>
You bring so much joy into my life<br/>
I'll love you always, my dear ragdoll<br/>
My precious kitty, my heart's delight<br/>
</p>
<p>
Oh, my ragdoll cat<br/>
You're the cutest thing I've ever had<br/>
Your purr is like music to my ears<br/>
I could hold you close, for years and years.<br/>
